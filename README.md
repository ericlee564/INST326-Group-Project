# INST326-Group-Project
Files:
    finalproject.py: Python script that allows the user to create a dataframe of their inventory using two files that are entered via command line arguments. 

    inventory.csv: A csv that contains the inventory of a store that has columns that include category, item name, amount, and price. It is used in the class and for a majority of the methods. This file has sample data that are used to test and run the program.

    Item_sold.csv: A csv file that contains the data of items sold for a store and has columns for the item name and amount sold. This csv file is used to update the inventory dataframe. The file has sample data for the items represented in the inventory.csv file that are used to test and run the program. 


Command Line Instructions:
    The program runs from a command line argument that contains two csv files, one of which has the inventory data of a store and the other that has the items sold and their amounts. 


How to Use Program/Interpret Results:
    After running the command line argument, the user will be faced with choices on what to be prompted to. This different capabilities represent methods that are in the class, and the user can choose to do different tasks with the options. The user will type in the number representing the task they want to do. 

    After the user selects their prompt, depending on the selection, they will either be provided a dataframe or an input option. For the input option, the user follows the prompt. A dataframe representing the user's desired information is the output.
